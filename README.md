# A-Bayesian-Approch-to-Modelling-Structural-Zeros-in-Microbiome-Data-using-Dirichlet-Processes-R
This R code implements the NeightFGS algorithm and the NeightmetroalFGS algorithm which are algorithms which tries to learn the FGS model. 
Furthermore empirical testing of the NeightFGS algorithm and the NeightmetroalFGS algorithm in their ability of learning the FGS model is done. 
In the end of the script there is code which implements the SecnealFGS algorithms, which also tries to learn the FGS model. 
See the Master thesis A Bayesian Approch to Modelling Structural Zeros in Microbiome Data using Dirichlet Processes by Sebastian Wetli in order to understand the theoretical background.
